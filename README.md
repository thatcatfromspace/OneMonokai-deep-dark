# One Monokai Deep Dark Theme
A deep-dark version to a great VSCode theme that is easy on the eyes. Since this is a fork of the original [One Monokai](https://github.com/azemoh/vscode-one-monokai) theme, you can either download all these files and place them in `~/.vscode/extensions` on Linux or instead, download the extension from Marketplace and replace `~/.vscode/extensions/azemoh.one-monokai-0.5.0/themes` with [themes](https://github.com/thatcatfromspace/vscode-one-monokai-deep-dark/tree/master/themes).
Feel free to suggest changes, request pulls or fork to make your own additions!
